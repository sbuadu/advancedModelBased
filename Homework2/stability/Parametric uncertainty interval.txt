Parametric uncertainty interval

Linear system:
Method:
Find K with L = 1.4;
Find eig(A-BK) when altering L affects A and B. 
Log for which value of L the eigen values have a positive real part.


Q/R = 10
L \in [0,2.9210]


Q/R = 1
L \in [0,4.1760]


Q/R = 0.1
L \in [0, 7.2110]



Nonlinear system:
Method: 
Set L value and run simulation. Plot theta to see when it becomes unstable. 
Q/R = 1. 

Stable for L \in [0, 3.58m]
