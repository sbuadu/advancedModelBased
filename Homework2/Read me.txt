Tests for LQR

Impuls on f, w aplitude 1 phase delay 3 sek. 

Cheap R = 0.1. 
Expensive R = 100.
Q = diag(1,1,1,1);


Parametric uncertainty interval

Linear system:
Method:
Find K with L = 1.4;
Find eig(A-BK) when altering L affects A and B. 
Log for which value of L the eigen values have a positive real part.

Q/R = 10
L \in [0,2.9210]


Q/R = 1
L \in [0,4.1776]
precision 5*10e-5


Q/R = 0.1
L \in [0, 7.2110]


Nonlinear system:
Method: 
Set L value and run simulation. Plot theta to see when it becomes unstable for
Q/R = 1.
